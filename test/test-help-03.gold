    File Patterns
        - The pattern '**' is a synonym for '...'.
        - The pattern '{a,b,c}' matches 'a', or 'b', or 'c'. Subparts may
          themselves be patterns.

    --breadthFirst
        Print results in breadth-first fashion (shallow entries before deep
        ones). By default, results are printed depth-first (all entries under
        one directory before proceeding to the next one).

    --debug, -D
        Turn on debugging output.

    --limit <count>, -l<count>
        Limit output to the first <count> matches.

    --maxDepth <depth>, -m<depth>
        Limit the descent depth to <depth> levels. Level 0 is files in current
        directory only, level 1 is entries of each subdirectory, and so on.

    --dirSlash, -d
        Print trailing slash for directory matches.

    --stream <fileName>|( <file1> <file2> ... <fileN> )
        Apply patterns against input stream of filenames. The special filename
        '--' reads filenames from standard input, and may be specified for a
        single option only. The multiple file option requires space-separated
        '(' and ')' delimiters.

    --ignore <fileName>|( <file1> <file2> ... <fileN> )
        Suppress output of files and directories that match rules inside a file
        of patterns. The special filename '--' reads from standard input, and
        may be specified for a single option only. The multiple file option
        requires space-separated '(' and ')' delimiters
