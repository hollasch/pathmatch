pathmatch: Report files and directories matching the specified pattern
usage    : pathmatch [<options>] <pattern> ... <pattern>

    `pathmatch` finds and reports all files and directories matching wildcard
    patterns. These patterns may contain the special characters '?', '*', and
    '...'. The '?' pattern matches any single character, '*' matches multiple
    characters except slashes, and '...' matches multiple characters including
    slashes. For example, the following patterns all match the file
    "abc\def\ghi\jkl": "abc\d?f\??i\jkl", "abc\*\*\jkl", "abc\...\jkl", and
    "ab...kl".

    The following command options are supported:

Command Options:
    --absolute, -a
        Report absolute paths. By default, reported paths are relative to the
        current working directory.

    --debug, -D
        Turn on debugging output.

    --dirSlash, -d
        Print trailing slash for directory matches.

    --files, -f
        Report files only (no directories). To report directories only, append
        a slash to the pattern.

    --help, /?, -?, -h
        Print help information.

    --ignore <fileName>|( <file1> <file2> ... <fileN> )
        Suppress output of files and directories that match rules inside a file
        of patterns. The special filename '--' reads from standard input, and
        may be specified for a single option only. The multiple file option
        requires space-separated '(' and ')' delimiters

    --limit <count>, -l<count>
        Limit output to the first <count> matches.

    --slash [/|\], -s[/|\]
        Specifies the slash direction to be reported. By default, slashes will
        be back slashes. Use "-s/" to report paths with forward slashes, "-s\"
        to report backslashes. A space is allowed before the slash.

    --stream <fileName>|( <file1> <file2> ... <fileN> )
        Apply patterns against input stream of filenames. The special filename
        '--' reads filenames from standard input, and may be specified for a
        single option only. The multiple file option requires space-separated
        '(' and ')' delimiters.

    --version, -v
        Print version information.
